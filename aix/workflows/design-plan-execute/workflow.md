# Agent Workflow

This document defines a reusable workflow for an AI coding agent operating in a product repository.

It is designed to support two distinct needs:

1. Bootstrapping a new project from zero.
2. Executing ongoing implementation work in an existing project.

The goal is to make the workflow easy to apply in order, while still preserving the planning, verification, and documentation discipline needed for reliable delivery.

## How to Use This Document

Use this document as the default process contract for the repo.

- If the repository also has an `AGENTS.md` file, treat that file as the repo-specific entrypoint.
- Use this document for the durable workflow rules that should remain reusable across projects.
- Use `.agents/README.md` as the reusable process router when it exists.
- Use `_docs/README.md` as the project documentation router when it exists.
- Use `_docs/design` for stable design truth.
- Use active plans in `_docs/plans` for implementation work and execution records.
- Use `_docs/plans/backlog` for planned work that has not been activated.
- Use completed plans only for relevant historical context.
- Use canonical object-verb skill names for agent workflow prompts.
  `project-init` initializes documentation scaffolding, `plan-create` writes
  backlog plans for review, and active implementation requires a later explicit
  `plan-activate` request.

## Work Classification

Classify the work before editing. The repository supports three work modes.
For every active-plan task, backlog review, or micro-fix, the agent must state
the selected work mode before changing files. If the work mode is unclear, or
if a backlog item appears to require implementation, stop and clarify instead
of editing.

### Backlog Work

Plans in `_docs/plans/backlog/` are planned but intentionally not started.
Agents may collaborate with the user to create and refine backlog plans,
including design intent, phases, tasks, risks, and verification. Backlog
planning is not implementation authorization.

An agent must not promote a backlog plan autonomously. Promotion requires
explicit human direction, either when the user manually moves the plan or
when the user asks the agent to promote it. The plan must be moved into
`_docs/plans/` before implementation begins.

### Active-Plan Work

Plans in `_docs/plans/` are authorized implementation work. The active plan
is the execution record: keep its task status current, implement in small
verifiable slices, run the relevant checks, update affected documentation,
and archive the plan only after completion requirements are met.

### Micro-Fix Work

A micro-fix may proceed without a broader plan when existing `_docs` already
capture the intended behavior and the change is a localized bug fix or UX/UI
improvement. The change must not introduce new design intent, architecture,
schema, security or data-safety behavior, or broad cross-module changes.

Escalate a micro-fix to a new plan or an existing active plan when its scope
expands, it changes accepted design intent, crosses subsystem boundaries,
requires a meaningful new workflow or contract, carries material production
or data-safety risk, or needs phased implementation. When the classification
is uncertain, clarify the scope before editing.

Completed plans in `_docs/plans/completed/` are historical execution records,
not default reading material. Read them when history, prior decisions,
migrations, or regressions make them relevant.

## Agent Task Lifecycle

Use this sequence for each concrete agent task, whether it is active-plan work
or a qualified micro-fix. The same sequence also governs backlog review, but
backlog work stops before implementation unless a human activates it.

1. **Orient:** Identify the user request, repository entrypoint instructions,
   relevant workflow guidance, applicable design docs, active or backlog plan
   context, and current worktree state. At minimum, read `AGENTS.md`,
   `.agents/workflow.md`, `_docs/README.md`, the relevant `_docs/design`
   files routed from the documentation index, the related active or backlog
   plans, and the current worktree status. Load completed plans only when they
   are needed for historical decisions, migrations, or regressions.
2. **Classify:** Decide and state whether the task is active-plan work, backlog
   work, or a micro-fix before editing. Stop for explicit authorization when
   the work is backlog-only or the classification is unclear.
3. **Plan:** Select the smallest coherent next task. For active-plan work,
   update task status in the plan before implementation. For a micro-fix,
   confirm the change remains within micro-fix criteria and know what completion
   record will be reported.
4. **Implement:** Make only the scoped change, following existing patterns and
   preserving safety-sensitive boundaries such as local files, external
   systems, credentials, persistence, publishing, and runtime contracts.
5. **Verify:** Identify and run targeted verification for the changed behavior
   first, then broader repository checks when the changed surface or plan
   requires them. Run broad checks only after targeted verification passes, or
   after a targeted-check failure or blocker has been recorded with its
   residual risk. Record exact commands, outcomes, skipped checks, and residual
   risk.
6. **Review:** Before closing a task named `Review & Refactor`, run the
   maintainability gate in `.agents/engineering-best-practices.md`. Record the
   file-size scan, responsibility audit for large changed production files, any
   refactors made, and any deferred risks. Do not mark the task complete while
   a correctness risk or obvious mixed-responsibility production file remains
   unplanned.
7. **Close:** Update plan status or the micro-fix completion record, report
   files changed, verification evidence, documentation impact, escalation
   status, and unresolved follow-up work. Promote durable current-state behavior
   into `_docs/design` when the implementation changes accepted design intent.

### Context Lifetime for Long-Running Skills

Long-running lifecycle skills should keep one parent orchestrator context in
charge of plan continuity. That parent context owns plan state, phase and task
sequencing, integration review, verification evidence review, documentation
impact, risk tracking, and closeout.

Bounded phase or task work may be delegated to a fresh sub-agent or fresh
context when context size, risk, or parallelism makes that safer or clearer.
Delegation is only appropriate when the parent context can preserve the
authoritative plan state and review the result before continuing. Delegated
work should return exact files changed, verification performed, remaining
risks, documentation impact, and whether scope expanded. The parent context
must reconcile that evidence with the active plan before selecting the next
task or phase.

Do not delegate work that depends on an unresolved product or design decision,
changes safety-sensitive behavior, has unclear authorization, or would require
the delegated context to overwrite unrelated worktree changes. Dependent tasks
should stay sequenced through the parent context; parallel delegation is only
appropriate for independent bounded checks or implementation slices.

If context size, worktree changes, or verification evidence become too large to
reason about confidently, stop and summarize the blocker instead of continuing
with partial state.

Do not add shell-script, CLI relaunch, or automatic session-resume
orchestration as part of the lifecycle by default. Deterministic process tooling
should be proposed only after the skill lifecycle has stabilized and repeated
execution shows a concrete need that skills alone cannot address clearly.

### Composed Execution Stop Conditions

Composed lifecycle execution must stop and return to diagnosis when continuing
would hide an unresolved decision, validation gap, or safety risk. Stop instead
of selecting the next task or phase when any of these conditions appear:

- unclear product or design decisions
- missing backlog activation authorization
- failed or blocked verification
- task, phase, or plan scope expansion
- underspecified safety-sensitive behavior involving local files, external
  systems, transfers, overwrites, deletes, renames, credentials, trust data,
  publishing, persistence, or runtime contracts
- relevant worktree conflicts or unrelated user changes that could be
  overwritten
- context that is too large to reason about confidently
- unexpected failures that need diagnosis before more implementation

## Bootstrap Command

If the user explicitly says `Initialize project`, treat that as a bootstrap command for a new or minimally scaffolded repository.

The bootstrap command should start the project using the lifecycle order defined in this document:

1. repository bootstrap
2. product framing
3. competitive analysis
4. MVP planning

The command should not jump directly into implementation unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Operating Principles

- Correctness over cleverness. Prefer boring, readable solutions that are easy to maintain.
- Smallest change that works. Minimize blast radius and avoid opportunistic refactors.
- Read before write. Find the existing implementation, pattern, and design context before editing.
- Prove it works. Do not mark work complete without verification or a clear statement of what could not be verified.
- Treat review as a gate, not a mood. A green test suite is not enough to close
  `Review & Refactor`; the maintainability scan and responsibility audit must
  also pass or create an explicit follow-up plan.
- Be explicit about uncertainty. If something is inferred or unverified, say so.
- Keep docs and code aligned. If implementation changes intended behavior, update the relevant docs as part of the work.
- Do not leave substantial design decisions only in chat or only in code.

## Standard Repository Layout

At minimum, a repo using this workflow should have the following documentation structure:

- `AGENTS.md`: repo-specific instructions, commands, priorities, and safety rules
- `.agents/README.md`: reusable agent process router
- `.agents/workflow.md`: the reusable workflow and planning contract
- `.agents/engineering-best-practices.md`: reusable agent-facing engineering guidance
- `.agents/skills/`: canonical repository-local agent workflow skills
- `_docs/design/`: stable design intent for the current accepted system
- `_docs/plans/`: active in-progress implementation plans
- `_docs/plans/backlog/`: planned but intentionally not started work
- `_docs/plans/completed/`: archived plans after design promotion and completion

Projects may also include these optional supporting files or directories:

- `.codex/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, or similar tool-specific skill directories:
  directory-level compatibility symlinks to `.agents/skills/` when an agent tool
  needs its own discovery path
- object-verb workflow skills such as `project-init`, `plan-create`,
  `plan-activate`, `plan-execute`, `task-execute`, and `work-verify`
- `_docs/competitive-analysis.md`: market and landscape analysis used before or during product shaping
- `_docs/design/overview/`: cross-cutting architecture, workspace shape, and runtime boundaries
- `_docs/design/features/`: feature-level design intent
- `_docs/design/product/`: product goals, user stories, scope, and requirements
- `_docs/design/quality/`: testing, validation, security, and acceptance guidance
- `_docs/design/operations/`: build, deployment, release, and support guidance

For long-term maintainability, the recommended design-doc structure is:

- `overview`: system shape and cross-feature invariants
- `features`: behavior of user-facing and domain features
- `product`: why the product exists and what it is trying to achieve
- `quality`: how correctness and acceptance are evaluated
- `operations`: how the system is built, verified, packaged, deployed, and supported

## Workflow by Lifecycle Stage

The workflow is easiest to follow when organized by the stage of work being performed.

### Stage 1: Repository Bootstrap

Use this stage when a project is new and the documentation structure does not yet exist.

Required outputs:

- the `_docs` directory structure exists
- the `.agents` process directory exists
- this workflow document exists under `.agents/workflow.md`
- optional `AGENTS.md` exists if repo-specific instructions are needed

Bootstrap checklist:

1. Create the documentation directories listed in `Standard Repository Layout`.
2. Decide whether the repository needs a repo-specific `AGENTS.md`.
3. Keep the workflow document generic enough to reuse across projects.
4. Reserve repo-specific commands, priorities, and safety rules for `AGENTS.md` or repo-specific design docs.

If the user invoked `Initialize project`, this stage should also:

5. confirm whether the repo already contains any bootstrap files or directories before creating them
6. create missing documentation structure needed for the remaining stages
7. prepare to run the structured discovery interview described in `Stage 2: Product Framing`

### Stage 2: Product Framing

Before implementation begins, create a concise product summary that captures the reason the product should exist.

Expected output:

- `_docs/design/product/product-summary.md`
- a short product summary, typically 1-2 pages

The product summary should cover:

- the problem being solved
- target users
- the value proposition
- core jobs to be done
- major constraints or non-goals
- early success criteria
- MVP scope boundaries

When this stage is part of `Initialize project`, the agent should lead the user through a structured discovery process instead of assuming the answers.

The discovery process should cover at least these categories:

- business and product:
  - product goals
  - business value
  - differentiation hypothesis
  - success criteria
- end users and experience:
  - primary user types
  - main user workflows
  - platform expectations
  - accessibility or usability expectations
- technology and delivery:
  - preferred stack
  - hosting, deployment, or distribution expectations
  - data, storage, auth, or integration constraints
  - testing, CI, release, and operational expectations

Unless the repository explicitly uses a different product-doc location, the default output path for this stage is `_docs/design/product/product-summary.md`.

The product summary document should be treated as the primary output of the initial product elicitation step.

Recommended document structure:

- product summary
- problem and opportunity
- target users
- value proposition
- primary user workflows
- success criteria
- MVP scope
- constraints and non-goals
- technology preferences and delivery constraints

### Stage 3: Competitive Analysis

Before investing deeply in implementation, understand the product landscape and determine whether the product is worth pursuing.

Expected output:

- `_docs/competitive-analysis.md` or an equivalent market-analysis document

The analysis should help answer:

- what alternatives already exist
- how the product can differentiate
- whether the market is attractive enough to justify development
- what risks, opportunities, and positioning considerations matter early

This document should inform product choices, not replace them.

When `Initialize project` is being used, this stage should happen after product framing so the analysis is grounded in an explicit product hypothesis.

### Stage 4: MVP Planning

Once the product goals and landscape are understood, define the first meaningful version of the product.

Expected output:

- an MVP plan document in `_docs/plans/backlog/` unless the user explicitly
  asks to activate an already reviewed plan

The MVP plan should:

- define the intended end state for the initial shippable product
- organize implementation into phases
- identify major risks, tradeoffs, and unknowns
- create a practical structure for execution

When the project has just been initialized, this plan should be derived from:

- the product summary
- the competitive analysis
- the current level of implementation readiness

Place new MVP plans in `_docs/plans/backlog/`. Move them into `_docs/plans/`
only after an explicit `plan-activate` request.

### Stage 5: Active Implementation

This is the main execution loop for day-to-day work.

Every non-trivial effort should run through the following sequence:

1. Review existing code, tests, design docs, and active plans.
2. Create a new plan or update an existing active plan.
3. Implement in small, verifiable slices.
4. Run the relevant verification.
5. Update docs to match the resulting accepted behavior.
6. Record lessons worth preserving.

If code, design docs, and plans disagree, identify the drift explicitly and resolve it deliberately.

### Stage 6: Completion and Design Promotion

Completing a plan means more than merging code.

Expected outputs:

- working code
- relevant verification completed, or verification gaps explicitly documented
- active plan updated to reflect the finished state
- durable design intent promoted into `_docs/design`
- completed plan archived under `_docs/plans/completed/`

The goal is that completed plans do not remain the only place where final design truth lives.

For a newly initialized project, the desired long-term outputs of this workflow are:

- working code
- strong verification coverage appropriate to the product
- stable design intent documents under `_docs/design`
- completed execution plans archived under `_docs/plans/completed/`

## Documentation Model

The documentation model separates reusable agent process, stable project truth,
and active execution.

### `.agents`

- This directory holds reusable AI-agent process structure.
- `.agents/workflow.md` captures workflow rules that can travel across projects.
- `.agents/engineering-best-practices.md` captures reusable agent-facing
  engineering guidance.
- `.agents/skills/` holds reusable workflow skills.
- Do not place project product knowledge, design truth, or execution records in
  `.agents/`.

### `_docs/design`

- This directory holds stable design intent for the application.
- Documents in this directory should describe the desired current state of the system.
- Stable design docs should reflect the latest accepted iteration of the codebase.
- Treat this directory as the durable reference for how the system is supposed to behave.

### `_docs/plans`

- This directory is the working space for planning and execution records.
- `_docs/plans/*.md` holds active in-progress work only.
- `_docs/plans/backlog/*.md` holds future work that is intentionally not started yet.
- `_docs/plans/completed/` holds archived plans after implementation and design promotion are finished.
- Every non-trivial effort starts with a plan document unless an existing active plan already covers the work.

### Relationship Between Code, Design, Plans, and Workflow

- Code is the implemented behavior.
- `_docs/design` is the stable design truth for the intended current system.
- `_docs/plans` is the temporary and evolving design space for active work.
- `_docs/plans/backlog` captures planned-but-not-started work.
- This document captures reusable workflow guidance learned across efforts.

When plan work is completed, durable design intent must be moved into `_docs/design`, and useful lessons should be harvested to improve this workflow.

## Plan Mode Default

Plan mode is the default starting point for non-trivial work.

- The first output of plan mode is a new or updated backlog plan document.
- The backlog plan is the source of truth for review until a later explicit
  activation moves it into active work.
- If new information changes the intended approach, update the plan document before continuing implementation.
- If a bug fix or validation issue is discovered while working an active plan, capture that work in the existing plan instead of creating a separate standalone plan.

### When Plan Mode Applies

- Multi-file changes
- Architectural or schema changes
- New features or major behavior changes
- Production-impacting fixes
- Work that will take multiple implementation phases

### When Plan Mode Can Be Skipped

- Localized bug fixes or UX/UI improvements when existing `_docs` already
  capture the intended behavior and there is no meaningful design impact
- Mechanical edits with obvious scope and negligible risk

Use the micro-fix escalation criteria in `Work Classification` when deciding
whether a change remains small enough to proceed without a plan.

## Micro-Fix Completion Record

A micro-fix does not need a one-off plan merely to satisfy process. Use the
normal conversation handoff as the execution record when the change is trivial,
localized, and still within the micro-fix criteria.

The final handoff for a micro-fix should include:

- Scope: what narrow behavior or document issue was changed
- Files changed: the concrete files touched
- Design docs reviewed: the stable docs checked for intended behavior, or why no
  design doc was relevant
- Verification: the targeted check, command, or manual review performed
- Documentation impact: whether stable design, lessons, engineering guidance, or
  no further docs changed
- Escalation: whether the work stayed a micro-fix or why it needed a plan

Use this compact format when it helps make the record clear:

```text
Micro-fix record:
- Scope:
- Files changed:
- Design docs reviewed:
- Verification:
- Documentation impact:
- Escalation:
```

Update `_docs/design` when the fix changes accepted current-state behavior or
clarifies behavior that future agents should treat as stable truth. Update
`_docs/lessons-learned.md` when the fix reveals a reusable product or
architecture lesson. Update `.agents/engineering-best-practices.md` or this
workflow when the fix changes how agents or engineers should work.

Escalate out of micro-fix handling as soon as the change grows beyond the
criteria in `Work Classification`. At that point, create or update a backlog
plan and wait for explicit activation before continuing implementation.

## Plan Document Requirements

Each plan document in `_docs/plans` should include, at minimum, the following sections.

### 1. Context

- What problem is being solved
- What repo, product, or market context was reviewed
- Any assumptions or constraints that materially shape the work

### 2. Design Intent

- The intended end state for the change
- The key behaviors, interfaces, boundaries, and invariants that should exist when the work is complete
- Any design decisions that should later become part of stable design documentation
- For backlog plans, track review acceptance inline on the relevant section
  heading once accepted, for example `### Design Intent (status: accepted)`.

### 3. Implementation Phases

- Organize the work into ordered phases
- Each phase should have a clear objective
- Each phase should contain concrete tasks
- Each phase should define success goals so completion can be judged explicitly
- Include verification expectations where relevant
- Every future or incomplete implementation phase must include a final
  `Review & Refactor` task
- The `Review & Refactor` task should be the last task in the phase, after
  implementation and targeted verification tasks
- Do not mark a phase complete until its `Review & Refactor` task is complete
  or an explicit follow-on risk has been recorded
- If a completed phase is reopened, mark its `Review & Refactor` task as
  in progress so the changed phase receives a fresh maintainability review
  before it is closed again
- When updating an active or backlog plan, add `Review & Refactor` to any
  future or incomplete phase that does not already include it
- For backlog plans, track phase acceptance inline on each phase heading once
  accepted, for example `#### Phase 1: Name (status: accepted)`.
- Do not add a detached review-gates section after acceptance. Status should
  stay with the section or phase it describes.

### Task Status Tracking

- Use `⬜️` for not started tasks
- Use `🟨` for tasks that are currently in progress
- Use `✅` for completed tasks
- Use `⚠️` for items that are implemented or substantially complete but still have a known validation gap, follow-up risk, or manual verification outstanding
- Apply these markers directly in phased task lists so plan progress is visible at a glance
- Keep task status current as work progresses so the plan document remains an accurate execution record

### 4. Open Questions, Risks, or Follow-On Work

- Capture unresolved decisions, rollout concerns, dependencies, and known tradeoffs

### 5. Lessons

- Capture implementation feedback, mistakes, surprises, and process improvements discovered during the work
- Record only lessons that are reusable or likely to matter again
- Bug-fix lessons discovered while executing an active plan should stay in that plan unless they are general enough to change this workflow

### 6. Promotion to Design

- Identify which `_docs/design` documents need to be created or updated when the work is complete

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Review Existing Context

- Read the relevant code, tests, and documentation before editing
- Check `_docs/design` for current intended behavior
- Check `_docs/plans` for active related implementation work
- Check `_docs/plans/backlog` for future work that may overlap or should be promoted to active
- Read `_docs/plans/completed` only when relevant historical context is needed
- If the work is early-stage product definition, also review the product summary and competitive analysis if they exist

### Active Plan Resolution

When an execution skill needs an active plan, resolve it this way:

1. If the user names a plan file, use that file.
2. If the user names no plan file, inspect active plan files directly under
   `_docs/plans/`.
3. Treat files under `_docs/plans/backlog/` as backlog plans and files under
   `_docs/plans/completed/` as completed plans, not active candidates.
4. If exactly one active plan file exists, select it and say it was selected
   because it is the only in-progress plan.
5. If no active plan file exists, stop and ask for the plan to execute.
6. If more than one active plan file exists, stop and ask which plan to use.
7. Stop if the selected plan is backlog or completed when active-plan work is
   required.

### 2. Create or Update the Plan

- Create a new backlog plan document for the change, or extend an existing active plan if the work clearly belongs there
- Place new plans in `_docs/plans/backlog/*.md`
- Move backlog work into `_docs/plans/*.md` only when the user explicitly requests `plan-activate`
- Do not implement backlog work until activation is complete
- Define the design intent and implementation phases before coding
- Prefer phased delivery that reduces risk and makes verification straightforward
- Do not create a separate bug-fix plan for issues found while validating or completing an already active implementation plan
- Create a standalone plan only when the work is independent of the current active plans

### 3. Implement in Small Slices

- Follow existing project conventions before introducing new abstractions
- Prefer thin, verifiable increments over broad changes
- Fix the problem at the right layer rather than patching symptoms
- Keep related docs updated when implementation materially changes the intended design

### 4. Verify Before Declaring Completion

- Choose the targeted test, deterministic check, or manual repro that most
  directly covers the changed behavior
- Tests may be written before, during, or after the implementation. The required
  outcome is that important design intent is locked down by automated tests when
  automation is practical.
- Use manual verification only when automated coverage would be impractical or
  low-value, and record that judgment in the plan or final handoff.
- Run broad repository checks only after targeted verification passes, or after
  a targeted-check failure or blocker is recorded with residual risk
- Run the relevant tests, lint, typecheck, build, or deterministic manual repro
- Compare baseline behavior against changed behavior when relevant
- If verification cannot be run, say what was not verified and how it should be checked

### 5. Review And Refactor Before Phase Closeout

Use this step to complete the final `Review & Refactor` task in each phase.

1. Review the phase's changed surface, including code, tests, docs, config,
   workflows, generated artifacts, and other changed project assets.
2. Check that the work is still understandable, cohesive, appropriately
   organized, and aligned with existing ownership boundaries and repository
   patterns.
3. Look for obvious maintainability issues introduced during the phase, such
   as mixed responsibilities, unclear names, duplicated rules, overly broad
   files or artifacts, hidden side effects, or tests that require excessive
   setup.
4. Apply small, behavior-preserving refactors that reduce the risk of carrying
   those issues forward.
5. Re-run the targeted verification affected by the refactor, plus any broader
   checks required by the phase.
6. If a structural issue is too large or risky to fix inside the phase, record
   it as an explicit risk or follow-on task before marking `Review & Refactor`
   complete.

Keep the review scoped to the phase's changed surface. Do not use phase
closeout for unrelated cleanup, speculative abstractions, or broad
reorganization that belongs in a separate plan.

### 6. Complete the Plan

- Confirm that the phase success goals were met
- Update the plan document to reflect what was completed, what changed, and any remaining risks or follow-on work
- Make sure the plan captures durable lessons worth preserving

## Plan Completion and Design Promotion

When work covered by a plan document is complete:

1. Verify that the implementation matches the intended outcome.
2. Move durable design intent into a new or existing document in `_docs/design`.
3. Remove ambiguity about what is still future work versus what is now stable design.
4. Review the plan's `Lessons` section.
5. Harvest reusable workflow improvements from those lessons into this document.
6. Move the completed plan document into `_docs/plans/completed/`.
7. Rename the completed plan file to prefix it with the completion date using `YYYY-MM-DD-<original-name>.md`.

### Completed Plan Archiving

- Completed plans should not remain mixed with active work in `_docs/plans`
- Archive completed plans under `_docs/plans/completed/`
- Prefix archived plan filenames with the completion date
- Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD-<current-name>.md`
- The date prefix should reflect when the plan was completed, not when it was first created

### Archive Readiness Checklist

Before archiving a plan, confirm all of the following:

- All plan tasks are marked as completed
- Stable design intent from the plan has been distributed into the appropriate files under `_docs/design`
- Related current-state docs outside `_docs/design` (for example `README.md`, handoff docs, or other repo-level reference docs) have been reviewed and updated if they describe the affected architecture, runtime, setup, QA flow, or release flow
- The `_docs/design` structure has been reviewed for any refactors or reorganization needed to keep the docs clear and easy to navigate
- Any new design docs are referenced from related docs where appropriate and can be discovered through the current design-doc entry points used by the repo
- Relevant verification is in a good state, with the goal of keeping the system dependable
- The plan no longer contains active implementation work, unresolved execution tasks, or validation follow-up that should remain in `_docs/plans`

## Communication Expectations

### During Work

- Provide concise progress updates when starting, when scope changes, when risks appear, or when verification fails
- Do not narrate every minor step
- Surface important assumptions and blockers clearly

### Final Delivery

- Lead with outcome and impact
- Reference concrete artifacts such as file paths, commands, or failing checks
- Summarize verification performed
- If something was not verified, state that directly
- Always report documentation impact: documents changed, documents reviewed
  with no change needed, or why documentation was not relevant to the task
- Call out doc updates when code or design intent changed

## Error Handling and Recovery

- If unexpected failures appear, stop adding scope and return to diagnosis
- Preserve evidence such as errors, logs, or repro steps
- Reproduce, localize, reduce, fix root cause, add coverage where appropriate, and verify the original report
- Prefer safe defaults and actionable failures over partial or silent behavior

## Coding and Design Rules

- Prefer explicit names and straightforward control flow
- Avoid adding dependencies unless the existing stack cannot solve the problem cleanly
- Keep error semantics consistent within a code path
- Validate untrusted input at boundaries
- Avoid type suppressions unless there is no reasonable alternative
- For UI work, preserve accessibility, predictable interactions, and clear states

## Git and Worktree Safety

- Treat a dirty worktree as normal and inspect before editing
- Never revert unrelated changes you did not make unless explicitly asked
- Do not overwrite user changes without understanding them
- Avoid destructive git operations unless explicitly requested
- Keep changes atomic and easy to review

## Definition of Done

A task is done when:

- The implementation matches the accepted design intent
- Important design intent has automated test coverage where practical
- Relevant verification has been run, or any gaps are explicitly documented
- The active plan document reflects the final state of the work
- The phase's `Review & Refactor` task has been completed, with any remaining
  structural concerns fixed or recorded as explicit follow-on work
- Durable design knowledge has been promoted into `_docs/design` when the work is complete
- Reusable lessons have been considered for inclusion in this document

## Plan Template

Use this shape for active plan documents in `_docs/plans` and optionally for backlog plans in `_docs/plans/backlog`.
