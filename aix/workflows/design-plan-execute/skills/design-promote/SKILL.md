description: Transfer accepted durable behavior from a completed implementation plan into the appropriate knowledge-base documentation. Use as a lifecycle procedure selected by project-manager or a delegated role, or when project-manager is not active.

# Design Promote

Promote accepted current-state behavior into `_docs/kb`, not speculative plan
intent or execution history.

## Project-Manager Entry Gate

When the active `project-manager` role is present, repo-changing,
project-mutating, lifecycle-state, planning, verification, documentation, or
other meaningful AIX project requests should reach this skill only after
project-manager routing and only when the project-manager or a delegated
role selects it as the procedure for bounded work.
Lifecycle skills are role-owned procedures, not default
direct request entrypoints.

If a direct user request or parent-context continuation reaches this skill
without PM routing context or a PM Context Packet, stop and route through
project-manager first. A parent context that received a PM Context Packet may
route, preserve worktree safety, review returned evidence, and report results;
parent review is minimal and exception-driven, trusting delegated role evidence
unless uncertainty, out-of-scope changes, failed tests, incomplete evidence,
safety-sensitive changes, or another role's need for exact file content gives a
concrete reason to re-read files. It must not run this lifecycle skill itself
to implement, verify, change lifecycle state, or perform repo-changing work
outside the delegated role.

Allowed bypasses are PM Review, tiny informational requests that require no
file reads, commands, lifecycle state, specialist judgment, or safety-sensitive
decisions, bootstrapping before project-manager is active, already-routed
requests carrying PM routing context or a PM Context Packet, and explicit
developer override.

## Role Collaboration

`design-promote` owns the promotion decision, knowledge-base documentation edits, and
user-facing handoff. Roles can supply bounded specialist judgment, but they do
not authorize new design truth or promote behavior that has not been
implemented and accepted.

When `.agents/roles/technical-architect/ROLE.md` exists and the completed work
changed architecture-sensitive behavior, use `delegate-to-role` or a
prompt-overlay delegation to request bounded architecture-promotion input.
Good triggers include system shape, component boundaries, module ownership,
runtime contracts, integration choices, data flow, persistence,
package-management behavior, workflow lifecycle behavior, or maintainability
tradeoffs.

Fold returned evidence into the knowledge-base update, related-doc placement,
boundary and invariant language, retained follow-up gaps, or promotion report
as appropriate. Do not require `technical-architect` for direct use. If the
role is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue promotion yourself by
checking the same architecture-sensitive current-state concerns. Do not use the
role to introduce speculative future behavior into `_docs/kb`.

When `.agents/roles/ux-writer/ROLE.md` exists and the completed work changed
durable product or developer-facing language, use `delegate-to-role` or a
prompt-overlay delegation to request bounded UX writing promotion input. Good
triggers include terminology, labels, prompts, command help, terminal output,
errors, empty states, onboarding copy, README language, workflow instructions,
release notes, or message-state requirements.

Fold returned evidence into the knowledge-base update, terminology or message
state contracts, related-doc placement, retained follow-up gaps, or promotion
report as appropriate. Do not require `ux-writer` for direct use. If the role
is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue promotion yourself by
checking the same copy, terminology, reader, task, and recovery-path concerns.
Do not use the role to promote unimplemented wording or final product claims
that still need developer review.

When `.agents/roles/documentation-specialist/ROLE.md` exists and promotion depends
on `_docs` placement, knowledge-base ownership, current-state accuracy,
related-doc links, README or workflow-doc impact, or separating plan history
from durable truth, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation to
request bounded documentation-promotion input.

Fold returned evidence into the knowledge-base update, related-doc placement,
index links, retained plan-history notes, README or workflow-doc follow-up,
review-and-refresh-docs handoff, unresolved gaps, or promotion report as
appropriate. Do not require `documentation-specialist` for direct use. If the
role is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue promotion yourself
by checking the same placement, ownership, link, and current-state accuracy
concerns. Do not use the role to promote unimplemented behavior or bypass
`review-and-refresh-docs`.

## Workflow

1. Read the completed or substantially completed plan and identify decisions
   that are now true in the codebase.
2. Inspect the design index and ownership rules in `_docs/README.md` and
   `_docs/kb/README.md`.
3. Treat completed plans as inspection guides, not proof. Verify current
   behavior against implementation, tests, and accepted knowledge-base docs
   before promotion.
4. Update the smallest appropriate `_docs/kb` product, requirements,
   architecture, security, quality, operations, decisions, or glossary document
   and its index links when needed. Use the workflow `kb/*` templates when a
   new knowledge-base document needs a reusable shape.
5. Remove ambiguity about what is current behavior versus future follow-on
   work.
6. Record unresolved implementation-vs-intent conflicts as open decisions,
   risks, or follow-up plan candidates instead of pretending promotion is
   complete.
7. Report promoted documents, retained historical details, implementation
   evidence inspected, and any gaps that prevent promotion.

## Guardrails

- Do not promote unimplemented, rejected, or explicitly future behavior.
- Do not duplicate an entire plan in the knowledge base.
- Keep execution status, migration history, and lessons in the plan or
  workflow guidance where they belong.
