# Plan Review

Review the referenced plan as an execution contract without changing code or
activating backlog work.

## Role Collaboration

`plan-review` owns the review result. Roles can supply bounded specialist
judgment, but they do not own readiness decisions, activation recommendations,
plan edits, lifecycle state, or user-facing findings.

When `.agents/roles/technical-architect.md` exists and the plan has
architecture-sensitive scope, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay
delegation to request a bounded architecture-readiness pass. Good triggers
include system boundaries, component contracts, module ownership, runtime
contracts, integration choices, data flow, persistence, package-management
behavior, workflow lifecycle behavior, implementation-phase sequencing, or
maintainability tradeoffs.

Fold returned evidence into review findings, activation blockers, risks,
verification gaps, requested plan revisions, or readiness notes as appropriate.
Do not require `technical-architect` for direct use. If the role is unavailable
or the host cannot delegate, continue the review yourself by checking the same
architecture-readiness concerns.

When `.agents/roles/product-strategist.md` exists and the plan has
product-scope, audience, value, sequencing, prioritization, opportunity-cost,
or product-fit risk, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation to
request a bounded product-strategy readiness pass.

Fold returned evidence into review findings, activation blockers, risks,
requested plan revisions, open questions, scope boundaries, or readiness notes
as appropriate. Do not require `product-strategist` for direct use. If the
role is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue the review yourself
by checking the same product-strategy readiness concerns.

When `.agents/roles/product-designer.md` exists and the plan has
product-facing UX scope, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation
to request a bounded design-readiness pass. Good triggers include user flows,
interaction design, accessibility, layout hierarchy, prototypes, terminal UX,
prompts, product-facing states, error or recovery paths, and design-system
fit.

Fold returned evidence into review findings, activation blockers, risks,
verification gaps, requested plan revisions, human-review notes, or readiness
notes as appropriate. Do not require `product-designer` for direct use. If the
role is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue the review yourself
by checking the same product-design readiness concerns.

When `.agents/roles/requirements-engineer.md` exists and the plan needs
requirements-readiness review, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay
delegation to request a bounded requirements pass. Good triggers include
requirements, actors, workflows, inputs, outputs, constraints, non-goals,
boundaries, invariants, acceptance signals, open decisions, Design Intent
readiness, and whether implementation phases were drafted too early.

Fold returned evidence into review findings, activation blockers, risks,
verification gaps, requested plan revisions, open questions, human-review
notes, or readiness notes as appropriate. Do not require
`requirements-engineer` for direct use. If the role is unavailable or the host
cannot delegate, continue the review yourself by checking the same
requirements-readiness concerns.

When `.agents/roles/security-engineer.md` exists and the plan has
security-sensitive scope, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation
to request a bounded security-readiness pass. Good triggers include trust
boundaries, secrets, authentication, authorization, permissions, dependency or
supply-chain risk, local file writes, overwrites, deletes, renames, external
systems, network access, package trust, workflow installation or updates,
source resolution, lockfile integrity, destructive operations, and no-write
guarantees.

Fold returned evidence into review findings, activation blockers, risks,
verification gaps, requested plan revisions, Security Review notes, human
review notes, or readiness notes as appropriate. Do not require
`security-engineer` for direct use. If the role is unavailable or the host
cannot delegate, continue the review yourself by checking the same
security-readiness concerns.

When `.agents/roles/ux-writer.md` exists and the plan has user-facing or
developer-facing copy scope, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay
delegation to request a bounded UX writing readiness pass. Good triggers
include labels, prompts, command help, terminal output, errors, empty states,
onboarding copy, README language, workflow instructions, release notes, or
docs copy that tells users what to do.

Fold returned evidence into review findings, activation blockers, risks,
verification gaps, requested plan revisions, human-review notes, or readiness
notes as appropriate. Do not require `ux-writer` for direct use. If the role
is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue the review yourself by
checking the same copy, terminology, message-state, recovery, and user-action
concerns.

When `.agents/roles/quality-engineer.md` exists and the plan needs
verification-readiness review, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay
delegation to request a bounded quality pass. Good triggers include acceptance
checks, targeted verification, regression risk, failure paths, manual
validation, skipped-check rationale, evidence expectations, validation gaps,
and residual risk.

Fold returned evidence into review findings, activation blockers, risks,
verification gaps, requested plan revisions, human-review notes, or readiness
notes as appropriate. Do not require `quality-engineer` for direct use. If the
role is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue the review yourself
by checking the same verification-readiness concerns.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the plan and read its context, design intent, phases, risks,
   verification, Security Review, and promotion requirements.
   Compare the plan against the active workflow `plan.md` template when that
   template is available. Local customization is fine, but missing required
   sections are workflow defects.
2. Read the repository instructions, documentation router, relevant `_docs/kb`
   docs, related active or backlog plans, and current worktree state. Read
   `_docs/design` only as a preserved migration comparison source when it
   exists and is relevant. Read completed plans only when specific historical
   decisions, regressions, or migrations are relevant to the review.
3. Check work classification and whether the requested phase is authorized.
4. Flag a missing `Completion Checklist` as a required-section defect that
   must be repaired before the plan is treated as ready or complete.
5. Report findings in priority order: missing decisions, conflicting sources
   of truth, unsafe assumptions, weak success criteria, and verification gaps.
6. State whether the plan is ready for execution and identify the exact
   blocking questions when it is not.

## Guardrails

- A backlog plan may be reviewed and refined, but never activated by review.
- Do not load completed plans as default context or treat them as current-state
  truth without a historical reason to consult them.
- Do not claim readiness when a material data-safety, credential,
  external-system, publishing, persistence, runtime-boundary, or contract
  decision remains unresolved.
- Do not claim readiness when a plan lacks required actors, workflows, inputs,
  outputs, constraints, non-goals, boundaries, acceptance signals, or
  decision timing for unresolved requirements.
- Do not claim readiness when a plan with security-sensitive scope lacks
  trust-boundary, credential, authorization, destructive-operation, dependency,
  failure-path, or safety-verification decisions.
- Do not claim readiness when verification expectations, regression-risk
  coverage, manual validation needs, skipped-check rationale, or acceptance
  evidence are too vague to guide implementation.
