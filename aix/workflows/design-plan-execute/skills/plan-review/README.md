# plan-review

## Skill Summary

Reviews an implementation plan as an execution contract without implementing
the work.

Installation:

```bash
aix init
```

This skill is workflow-owned. `aix init` installs the default
`design-plan-execute` workflow and activates this skill with it. To install the
workflow explicitly, run:

```bash
aix workflow install https://github.com/tekfoundry/ai-extensions/tree/master/aix/workflows/design-plan-execute aix
```

Dependencies:

- The referenced active or backlog plan
- `AGENTS.md`
- `_docs/README.md`
- Relevant `_docs/design/` documents
- Related active or backlog plans, when relevant
- The active workflow `plan.md` template, when available

## How to use it

Here are example prompts that invoke this skill:

- "Use plan-review on `_docs/plans/backlog/search-filters.md`."
- "Review this plan for readiness before activation."
- "Assess whether Phase 2 has enough detail to execute safely."

## When it is used

Use this skill when the developer wants a plan checked for scope,
authorization, design completeness, risks, and verification readiness.

## What it does

The skill reads the referenced plan, repository instructions, documentation
router, relevant design docs, related plans, and worktree state. It reports
missing decisions, conflicting sources of truth, unsafe assumptions, weak
success criteria, and verification gaps in priority order. It states whether
the plan is ready for execution and names the exact blockers when it is not.
When the workflow-owned `technical-architect` role is installed, the skill can
use it for bounded architecture-readiness review while still checking
architecture concerns itself when the role is unavailable. When the
workflow-owned `product-strategist` role is installed, the skill can use it
for bounded product-strategy readiness review on audience, value, scope,
sequencing, prioritization, and product fit while still checking those
concerns itself when the role is unavailable. When the
workflow-owned `product-designer` role is installed, the skill can use it for
bounded design-readiness review on user flows, interaction states,
accessibility, terminal UX, prompts, and design-system fit while still checking
those concerns itself when the role is unavailable. When the workflow-owned
`security-reviewer` role is installed, the skill can use it for bounded
security-readiness review on trust boundaries, secrets, authorization,
destructive operations, dependency risk, source resolution, lockfile integrity,
and no-write guarantees while still checking those concerns itself when the
role is unavailable. When the workflow-owned `ux-writer` role is installed,
the skill can use it for bounded copy-readiness review on labels, prompts,
command help, terminal output, errors, empty states, onboarding copy, README
language, and developer-facing docs while still checking those concerns itself
when the role is unavailable.
