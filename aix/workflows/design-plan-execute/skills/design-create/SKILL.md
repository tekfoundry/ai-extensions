# Design Create

Use this skill when a new durable current-state knowledge-base document is
needed. Prefer updating an existing `_docs/kb` document when the topic already
has a clear home.

## Role Collaboration

`design-create` owns the knowledge-base document, placement decision, template
use, index links, and user-facing handoff. Roles can supply bounded specialist
judgment, but they do not own final current-state truth or promote speculative
architecture.

When `.agents/roles/technical-architect/ROLE.md` exists and the knowledge-base document
concerns system shape, component boundaries, module ownership, runtime
contracts, integration choices, data flow, persistence, package-management
behavior, workflow lifecycle behavior, or maintainability tradeoffs, use
`delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation to request bounded
architecture input.

Fold returned evidence into the knowledge-base document's current-state behavior,
ownership boundaries, invariants, constraints, tradeoffs, related-doc links,
or unresolved gaps as appropriate. Do not require `technical-architect` for
direct use. If the role is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue
the knowledge-base document creation yourself by checking the same architecture
concerns.

When `.agents/roles/product-designer/ROLE.md` exists and the knowledge-base document
concerns product-facing behavior, user flows, interaction states,
accessibility, layout hierarchy, prototypes, terminal UX, prompts, or
design-system fit, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation to
request bounded product-design input.

Fold returned evidence into the knowledge-base document's current-state behavior,
user-flow expectations, interaction states, accessibility and usability
constraints, layout or hierarchy notes, related-doc links, human-review notes,
or unresolved gaps as appropriate. Do not require `product-designer` for direct
use. If the role is unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue the
knowledge-base document creation yourself by checking the same product-design
concerns.

When `.agents/roles/ux-writer/ROLE.md` exists and the knowledge-base document records
durable product or developer-facing language, use `delegate-to-role` or a
prompt-overlay delegation to request bounded UX writing input. Good triggers
include terminology, labels, prompts, command help, terminal output, errors,
empty states, onboarding copy, README language, workflow instructions, or
message-state requirements.

Fold returned evidence into the knowledge-base document's current-state behavior,
terminology, message-state expectations, copy constraints, related-doc links,
human-review notes, or unresolved gaps as appropriate. Do not require
`ux-writer` for direct use. If the role is unavailable or the host cannot
delegate, continue the knowledge-base document creation yourself by checking the same
copy, terminology, reader, task, and recovery-path concerns.

When `.agents/roles/documentation-specialist/ROLE.md` exists and the knowledge-base
document placement, ownership, index coverage, related-doc links,
current-state accuracy, or separation between stable truth and plan history is
material, use `delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation to request
bounded documentation input.

Fold returned evidence into the knowledge-base document's placement decision,
current-state behavior, related-doc links, index updates, ownership boundary,
promotion notes, human-review notes, or unresolved gaps as appropriate. Do not
require `documentation-specialist` for direct use. If the role is unavailable
or the host cannot delegate, continue the knowledge-base document creation yourself by
checking the same documentation structure, placement, link, and current-state
accuracy concerns. Do not use the role to create a new doc when a focused
update to an existing doc is clearer.

## Workflow

1. Read `_docs/README.md` and `_docs/kb/README.md` to understand the
   current documentation map and ownership rules.
2. Decide the smallest appropriate home under `_docs/kb/`, such as product,
   requirements, architecture, security, quality, operations, decisions, or
   glossary.
3. Check nearby docs before creating a new file. Update an existing document
   when that keeps ownership clearer.
4. When creating a new file, use the workflow `kb/*` template that best fits
   the document type when one exists.
5. Write current-state knowledge. Cover behavior, ownership boundaries,
   constraints, evidence, failure modes, and links to related docs. Keep plan
   history in plans.
6. Link the new or moved document from the relevant index, usually
   `_docs/kb/README.md` or an area `README.md`.
7. Report created or updated docs, index changes, unresolved gaps, and whether
   the template was missing.

## Guardrails

- Do not create a new knowledge-base document when a focused update to an
  existing doc is clearer.
- Do not promote speculative, rejected, or unimplemented behavior as current
  knowledge.
- Do not copy an implementation plan into `_docs/kb/`.
- Keep one document responsible for one coherent topic.
- Preserve project-owned documentation and unrelated edits.
