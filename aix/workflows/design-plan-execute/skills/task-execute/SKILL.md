# Task Execute

Use this skill for exactly one smallest implementation unit in the repository
lifecycle. One task should be narrow enough to understand, implement, verify,
and report without losing plan context. The referenced plan, repository
instructions, and current code are authoritative.

Do not use this skill to activate backlog work, complete an entire phase by
default, or broaden the task into adjacent refactors.

## Project-Manager Entry Gate

When the active `project-manager` role is present, repo-changing,
project-mutating, lifecycle-state, planning, verification, documentation, or
other meaningful AIX project requests should reach this skill only after
project-manager routing and only when the project-manager or a delegated
role selects it as the procedure for bounded work.
Lifecycle skills are role-owned procedures, not default
direct request entrypoints.

If a direct user request or parent-context continuation reaches this skill
without PM routing context or a PM Context Packet, stop and route through
project-manager first. A parent context that received a PM Context Packet may
route, preserve worktree safety, review returned evidence, and report results;
parent review is minimal and exception-driven, trusting delegated role evidence
unless uncertainty, out-of-scope changes, failed tests, incomplete evidence,
safety-sensitive changes, or another role's need for exact file content gives a
concrete reason to re-read files. It must not run this lifecycle skill itself
to implement, verify, change lifecycle state, or perform repo-changing work
outside the delegated role.

Allowed bypasses are PM Review, tiny informational requests that require no
file reads, commands, lifecycle state, specialist judgment, or safety-sensitive
decisions, bootstrapping before project-manager is active, already-routed
requests carrying PM routing context or a PM Context Packet, and explicit
developer override.

## Role Collaboration

`task-execute` owns the selected task, implementation slice, targeted
verification, plan status update, and task closeout evidence. Roles can supply
bounded specialist judgment, but they do not own task selection, file edits,
command execution, lifecycle state, or final completion decisions.

When `.agents/roles/quality-engineer/ROLE.md` exists and the task's success depends
on choosing or judging targeted checks, use `delegate-to-role` or a
prompt-overlay delegation to request bounded quality input. Good triggers
include non-trivial changed behavior, failure paths, regression risk, manual
validation, skipped-check rationale, acceptance evidence, or residual risk.

Fold returned evidence into targeted verification, manual check notes,
validation gaps, residual risk, follow-on tasks, or task completion evidence as
appropriate. Do not require `quality-engineer` for direct use. If the role is
unavailable or the host cannot delegate, continue the task yourself by checking
the same verification and regression concerns.

When `.agents/roles/implementation-engineer/ROLE.md` exists and the task's
implementation boundary is non-trivial, use `delegate-to-role` or a
prompt-overlay delegation to request bounded implementation input before
editing. Good triggers include unclear task scope, likely changed files, test
or fixture ownership, dependency order, file-operation risk, compatibility
paths, documentation impact, or whether the task should be split before code
changes begin.

Fold returned evidence into task readiness, implementation notes, file-change
plan, targeted verification, documentation impact, validation gaps, residual
risk, follow-on tasks, or task completion evidence as appropriate. Do not
require `implementation-engineer` for direct use. If the role is unavailable or
the host cannot delegate, continue the task yourself by checking the same
scope, ownership, sequencing, verification-handoff, and documentation-impact
concerns.

## 1. Orient

1. Resolve the plan file using `Active Plan Resolution` in
   `.agents/workflow.md`.
2. Resolve the current phase and task. If the user specifies a task, use that
   task. If the user specifies only a phase, inspect the open tasks in that
   phase and select the best next task based on dependency order, readiness,
   risk, and smallest coherent progress. If the user names neither a phase nor
   a task, infer the current phase as the first phase, in document order, with
   any task marked `⬜️`, `🟨`, or `⚠️`, then select the best next open task in
   that phase. If no phase has open, in-progress, or validation-gap tasks,
   report that the plan has no task to execute.
   Reconciliation, status-update, or "sync with worktree" requests still count
   as one task: select exactly one checklist item, one phase-local status item,
   or one narrowly named reconciliation note. Do not mark multiple plan tasks,
   phases, or verification groups complete in a single `task-execute` turn
   unless the user explicitly identified that exact single aggregate item as the
   task.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/workflow.md`, `_docs/README.md`, the relevant
   `_docs/kb` docs, and the containing plan section.
4. Read nearby task status, dependencies, success goals, verification
   requirements, risks, and promotion-to-design guidance from the plan. Use the
   active workflow `plan.md` template as a consistency reference for task and
   execution-note shape when it is available.
5. Inspect the relevant implementation files, tests, and current worktree
   status. Preserve unrelated user changes.

Keep context focused. Read completed plans only for relevant historical
decisions, regressions, or migration evidence.

## 2. Classify and Authorize

Classify the task before editing, and state the selected work mode before
changing files:

- **Active-plan task:** A task in `_docs/plans/` is authorized when the plan is
  active and the requested task belongs to its stated scope.
- **Backlog task:** A task under `_docs/plans/backlog/` is not authorized for
  implementation. Stop and explain that explicit human activation is required.
- **Micro-fix task:** A narrow task may proceed without an active plan only when
  existing design intent covers it and it does not add architecture, schema,
  security, data-safety behavior, or broad workflow changes.

If classification or authorization is uncertain, ask one concise blocking
question. Do not move plans between backlog, active, or completed locations.

## 3. Check Readiness

Proceed only when all are true:

- The task has a concrete expected outcome.
- The task can be completed without inventing material product, architecture,
  security, data-safety, external-system, transfer, delete, overwrite, trust,
  publishing, persistence, or runtime-contract behavior.
- Required design context and implementation patterns are available.
- No relevant worktree conflict or unrelated change would be overwritten.
- Targeted verification can be identified before editing.

If the task is already complete, report the evidence and avoid rewriting it.
If the task expands beyond its phase or plan, stop and report the expansion.
If accurate status reconciliation would require marking multiple independent
tasks or phases complete, update only the selected task and leave the remaining
status changes for later `task-execute`, `phase-execute`, or `plan-execute`
work.

## 4. Implement

For an authorized and ready task:

1. Mark the task in progress using the plan's existing status convention when
   the task belongs to an active plan.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the task.
3. Update tests or documentation needed to keep behavior and intent aligned.
4. Preserve existing safeguards around local files, external systems,
   transfers, overwrites, deletes, renames, credentials, trust data,
   publishing, persistence, and runtime contracts.
5. Stop on unexpected failure, ambiguous safety behavior, or scope expansion.

Avoid unrelated cleanup, dependency changes, formatting churn, or broad
refactors unless they are required for the task.

## 5. Verify

Identify and run targeted verification first, then broader checks only as
needed for the changed surface and the plan's requirements. Run broad checks
only after targeted verification passes, or after a targeted-check failure or
blocker has been recorded with residual risk.

Report exact commands and results. If a check cannot run, state the command,
the reason, and the residual risk.

Use the repository's documented checks when applicable, such as tests, type
checks, builds, linting, smoke checks, or packaging/release validation for the
affected subsystem.

## 6. Close the Task

After verification:

- Mark the task complete in the plan when it belongs to an active plan.
- Do not mark sibling tasks, later phase tasks, or whole-plan verification
  items complete merely because evidence for them was observed while orienting.
- Add brief evidence or a completion note when the plan needs it for later
  agents.
- Record remaining risks, skipped checks, or follow-on tasks instead of hiding
  them.
- Keep plan task and evidence updates aligned with the active workflow
  `plan.md` template when it is available.
- Report files changed, verification performed, documentation impact, and
  whether escalation was needed.

A task is not complete merely because files changed. Completion requires the
task outcome, plan expectations, and relevant verification evidence.
