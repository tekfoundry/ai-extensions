# Code Review Refactor

Use this skill when the developer asks for a codebase maintainability review,
refactor recommendations, or help turning review findings into safe refactor
work.

## Project-Manager Entry Gate

When the active `project-manager` role is present, meaningful AIX project
requests should reach this skill only after project-manager routing or a
delegated role selects it as the procedure for bounded work. Lifecycle skills
are procedures selected by the project-manager or delegated roles, not default
direct request entrypoints.

If a direct user request reaches this skill without PM routing context or a PM
Context Packet, stop and route through project-manager first.

Allowed bypasses are PM Review, tiny informational requests that require no
file reads or commands, bootstrapping before project-manager is active,
already-routed requests carrying PM routing context or a PM Context Packet,
and explicit developer override.

## Pre-flight

1. Read the repository entrypoint instructions, usually `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read focused review and maintainability guidance from the active role or
   workflow guidance files that apply to the requested code area.
3. If focused guidance is missing or incomplete for the requested review, use
   the repository's current workflow rules and knowledge-base docs instead of
   stopping solely because a legacy guidance file is absent. Report the
   guidance gap in the review.
4. Read the project documentation router when it exists, usually
   `_docs/README.md`, then read only the design docs needed for the requested
   code area.
5. Check the current worktree status. Preserve user-authored files and
   unrelated changes.

Do not hard-code file-size thresholds, ownership rules, testing expectations,
or refactor policy from memory. Use the current focused guidance, repository
instructions, and project documentation.

## Default scope

Review project code files by default.

Include ordinary source, test, script, configuration, and package code when
they affect runtime, build, verification, or developer workflows.

Exclude documentation, process files, generated output, dependency folders,
package-manager state, caches, coverage output, build output, and local agent
package stores unless the developer explicitly asks to include them. Common
excluded paths include:

- `_docs/`
- `.agents/`
- `.codex/`
- `.claude/`
- `dist/`
- `build/`
- `coverage/`
- `node_modules/`
- package lockfiles

If the requested scope is broad, start with repository-native file discovery
and size scans. Prefer `rg --files` when available. Use a documented fallback
such as `find` when it is not.

## Review checks

Review for correctness and maintainability before style.

When `.agents/roles/technical-architect/ROLE.md` exists and the requested review
involves architectural coupling, module ownership, runtime contracts,
integration boundaries, data flow, persistence, workflow lifecycle behavior,
package-management behavior, or large cross-module refactors, use
`delegate-to-role` or a prompt-overlay delegation to request a bounded
architecture-risk pass.

Fold returned evidence into the normal review findings, refactor
recommendations, suggested process mode, verification impact, documentation
impact, or plan-mode scope as appropriate. Do not require
`technical-architect` for direct use. If the role is unavailable or the host
cannot delegate, continue the review yourself by checking the same architecture
and ownership concerns. The role must not choose findings, approve refactors,
edit files, or bypass the developer confirmation gate.

Check for:

- unclear ownership boundaries
- files with multiple reasons to change
- large production files that need a responsibility audit
- duplicated domain rules, validation, error mapping, or contract shapes
- weak module names or locations that hide ownership
- runtime, filesystem, network, persistence, or security behavior mixed into
  presentation or command dispatch code
- missing or brittle tests around non-trivial logic
- error handling that hides failures or leaks sensitive details
- safety-sensitive operations without explicit safeguards
- documentation drift when code behavior has changed

Treat file size as a signal, not a verdict. Generated files, fixtures, schemas,
parsers, and narrow lookup tables may be large for valid reasons.

## Finding format

Lead with findings. Order them by severity and practical risk.

Use one visible marker per finding. Prefer a numbered list:

```text
1. Init is not transactionally composed
```

Do not combine numbered list markers with visible priority badges such as
`1. P1 ...`. If severity matters, put it inside the finding body as plain
text, for example `Severity: high`.

Each finding should include:

- severity as plain text when it helps the developer decide
- concrete file reference with line number when possible
- evidence from the code
- why it makes future changes riskier
- recommended refactor direction
- expected verification impact

Keep recommendations focused. Avoid listing every minor style preference.

## Refactor selection

The review produces recommendations first. Do not choose broad refactors for
the developer.

After presenting findings, ask the developer which finding numbers they want
to refactor. They may choose one, several, or all. Accept natural replies such
as `1`, `1 and 3`, `1, 2, 4`, or `all`.

Before selecting a process mode or editing files, repeat the selected set back
to the developer and ask for confirmation. The confirmation should include:

- the selected finding numbers
- a one-line title for each selected finding
- the recommended process mode
- the reason for that mode

Do not proceed until the developer confirms the selected findings and mode.

## Process modes

Recommend one process mode after the developer selects findings.

### Inline mode

Use inline mode for small, isolated, behavior-preserving fixes that do not
change design intent and do not touch many files. Inline work should have a
small blast radius, clear verification, and no unresolved product,
architecture, security, persistence, external-system, or runtime-contract
decision.

When inline mode is confirmed, perform the selected refactors in the confirmed
finding order unless the developer gives a different order. Keep each change
small, preserve unrelated worktree changes, and verify the result before
moving to the next selected finding.

### Plan mode

Use plan mode for larger, cross-cutting, or intricate refactors. Prefer plan
mode when selected findings interact with each other, touch several ownership
areas, require sequencing, change design intent, alter public behavior, affect
runtime contracts, touch persistence or security, or need broader tests.

When plan mode is confirmed, use the `plan-create` skill to create a backlog
review-and-refactor plan. The plan should capture the selected findings as
scope, organize phases and tasks, and define risks and verification. Stop
after the plan is created so the developer can follow the standard lifecycle:
approve, activate, execute, and complete.

## Refactor flow

After confirmation:

1. For inline mode, implement the selected findings in the confirmed order.
2. For plan mode, create a backlog plan with `plan-create` and stop for normal
   review and approval.
3. If the review is running inside an active plan, record selected findings,
   mode, evidence, verification, and residual risks in that plan.
4. If the selected work expands beyond the confirmed mode, stop and ask the
   developer whether to switch modes or narrow the scope.

The developer may cancel at any point.

## Active-plan behavior

When the review runs inside an active plan, record the review findings,
selected refactor, verification evidence, and residual risks in that active
plan. Do not create a separate plan unless the selected work is outside the
active plan's scope.

When the review runs outside an active plan, keep the review as advisory until
the developer selects work. Route substantial selected refactors through
backlog planning, developer approval, activation, and plan execution before
implementation.

## Guardrails

- Preserve behavior unless the developer explicitly approves a behavior change.
- Preserve user-authored files and unrelated worktree changes.
- Prefer local patterns and existing abstractions.
- Avoid broad rewrites from the recommendation list.
- Do not introduce dependencies or new static-analysis engines unless the
  developer approves that plan.
- Select verification before editing.
- Add characterization tests before risky refactors.
- Stop for unclear product, architecture, security, data-safety, persistence,
  publishing, external-system, transfer, delete, overwrite, trust, or runtime
  contract decisions.

## Closeout

Report files changed, verification run, skipped checks, documentation impact,
and remaining risks. If implementation changed durable behavior or accepted
architecture, update the relevant design documentation.
