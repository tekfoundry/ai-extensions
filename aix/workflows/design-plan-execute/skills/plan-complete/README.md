# plan-complete

## Skill Summary

Closes an implementation plan after tasks, human validation, verification,
design promotion, risks, and documentation impact have been resolved or
recorded.

Installation:

```bash
aix init
```

This skill is workflow-owned. `aix init` installs the default
`design-plan-execute` workflow and activates this skill with it. To install the
workflow explicitly, run:

```bash
aix workflow install aix/workflows/design-plan-execute
```

Dependencies:

- The active implementation plan under `_docs/plans/`
- Required targeted and repository verification commands
- The plan's `Security Review` section
- `design-promote`
- `review-and-refresh-docs`
- The active workflow `plan.md` template, when available

## How to use it

Here are example prompts that invoke this skill:

- "Use plan-complete on `_docs/plans/search-filters.md`."
- "Complete and archive the active plan."
- "Close out the workflow update plan."

## When it is used

Use this skill when active plan work appears finished and needs formal closeout.
It is not used to archive backlog plans or hide incomplete work.

## What it does

The skill resolves the plan, confirms all tasks and success goals, requires
developer validation or an explicit recorded waiver, reviews or runs required
verification, completes the Security Review gate, promotes durable behavior
with `design-promote`, reviews documentation with `review-and-refresh-docs`,
records remaining risks and follow-on work, updates the completion checklist
when present, and archives the completed plan under `_docs/plans/completed/`
with the required dated filename. When the workflow-owned `security-engineer`
role is installed, the skill can use it for bounded post-phase security review
while still checking security-sensitive behavior itself when the role is
unavailable. When the workflow-owned `ux-writer` role is installed, the skill
can use it for bounded final copy-readiness review when completed work changed
labels, prompts, command help, errors, empty states, onboarding copy, README
language, release notes, or developer-facing docs. When the workflow-owned
`documentation-specialist` role is installed, the skill can use it for bounded
final documentation-impact review before archive while still running
`design-promote` and `review-and-refresh-docs` as the closeout procedures.
